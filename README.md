**This project study diamonds dataset ,then predict diamonds price 
_the dataset split into two files :_
_1-training data used to train the model_
2-testin data used to test the model .**

# Diamonds EDA

# Diamonds Model
in this file I impute missing values and incorrect outliers,
encoding categorical features, adding new features, 
rescaling the features and the target ,split data, and then i used Stacking Regressor model and fine tuning hyperparameter in the model to get more accuracy.
Finally, the result of **RMSE** on testing data is **456.00616.**
